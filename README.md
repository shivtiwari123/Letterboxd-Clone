# Letterboxd Clone

This website is an attempt at cloning Letterboxd, which I'm sure most cinephiles would be aware of. It is a very propular movie database/review/rating website and very highly revered as well. But my clone here has a twist, it can do shows as well.

The tech stack for this website is:

   1. React.js
   2. Vite.js
   3. Firebase

To get the data for the Movies & TV Shows, The Movie Database's (TMDB) API was called.


So, coming to the landing page, this is how it looks.

As seen in the picture above, there is a slider for trending content which can be sorted according to 2 criterias - "Today" and "This week". So the user can choose their own poison.

Upon Clicking a movie or a TV Show of their choice, they're brought to it's information page, where the user has an option to add the particular piece of media to their watchlist. However, that will be possible if and only if they have logged in to their account.

Along with getting an overview of the media, the user can also check the cast and can find links for videos related to the media, on the internet:

After successfully logging in, the user can add any show or movie to their watchlist:

Coming to the Movies tab in the Navbar, the user can discover a plethora of movies and can sort them on the basis of "Popularity" and "Top rated". 
Same goes for the Shows tab in the navbar as well.

Coming to the search icon, here the user can search for any movie or show by typing any keyword which is in its name. The results will be in multiple pages, and the user can browse through them all.

Lastly, when the user clicks their own icon, they get a dropdown menu, with 2 options - "Watchlist" and "Logout".

Clicking "Watchlist" will take the user to their watchlist, where they can again edit it by clicking the "green tick" on the top left corner of the poster images of the media present in the watchlist.

And as the name suggests, clicking "Logout" logs the user our of their account, but their watchlist remains intact and can be accessed whenever they log back in.

And last but not the least, the website is responsive. So the user can make use of it from any device of their choice.
